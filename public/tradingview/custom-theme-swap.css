/*
 * Red-Up Green-Down color swap for Chinese market convention.
 *
 * Only affects the LIGHT theme (:root without .theme-dark).
 * Swaps green (growing/positive) and red (falling/negative) themed CSS variables
 * so that price increases show red and decreases show green.
 *
 * This approach avoids the custom_themes API which requires providing ALL 7 color
 * palettes and causes side effects (darker separators) when non-swapped palette
 * values don't match the library's internal defaults.
